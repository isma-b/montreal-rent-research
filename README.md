# Montreal Rental Market Analysis

I undertook this project to examine the factors that influence apartment rental prices in Montreal using a hands on data science approach. The core objective was to move beyond theoretical exercises and work with real world data that I collected myself, focusing on understanding the practical dynamics of the local housing market.

Kijiji served as my primary data source because it offers the most comprehensive collection of Montreal rental listings. The platform's blend of French and English content provides an authentic representation of the city's rental landscape, while its consistent structure made systematic data collection feasible.

The project follows a standard data science workflow. I began by developing a web scraper to gather listing data, then progressed to cleaning and validating the dataset. The analysis phase involved exploratory data visualization to identify patterns, followed by building predictive models to quantify the relationships between apartment features and rental prices.

This approach allowed me to test whether observable features like bedroom count and location could reliably predict pricing. The findings provide concrete insights into how Montreal's rental market operates, revealing which factors landlords and tenants value most in practice.

The complete analysis is documented in two Jupyter notebooks. The first covers data collection and preprocessing, while the second focuses on exploratory analysis and model building. Both notebooks include detailed comments explaining the methodology and rationale behind each step.

This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to real world questions about urban housing markets. It shows that even publicly available data, when properly collected and analyzed, can yield meaningful insights into complex social and economic phenomena.
